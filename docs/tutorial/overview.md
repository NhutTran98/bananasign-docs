# Overview

The Bananasign integration allows you to launch a fully-compliant digital signing flow from your web or mobile application in a few easy steps. At a high-level you will:

1. Display a Bananasign start page to your customer
2. Create a new Bananasign contract by calling the API
3. Display the contract setup flow to the customer in an iframe

Once you have loaded the Bananasign iframe, Bananasign will take care of the rest. The contract will be emailed to signers and Bananasign will facilitate the signing process. Your application can track the progress of the signing workflow via the Bananasign API. The completed contract can be downloaded via the API.
