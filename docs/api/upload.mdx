*How do API users to upload their PDF to Bananasign?*

We will provide complete documentation and working code examples for this upload flow. At a high-level view, the current process is:

* Once the 3rd party initializes the signing flow, Lumin generates a S3 presigned url to a temporary bucket with an expiration time of 15/30 mins
* The 3rd party, then, uploads the file to our temporary bucket
* The 3rd party calls our API to add signers & viewers
* Bananasign backend gets the file from S3 along with payload from the request to finish the signing flow

Bananasign has a bucket life cycle set to clean up the bucket every day for expired files
